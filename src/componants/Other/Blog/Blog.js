                    <p>
                        1. SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational. <br />
                        2. SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. <br />
                        3.SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.

                    <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.</p>

                    <p>Node JS is one of the most popular runtime environments, to build backend servers. Despite of its single-threaded nature, Node JS performs quite well because of its asynchronous and non-blocking behavior. It is regularly used to build backend servers that interact with websites, mobile applications, and more. Letâ€™s take a look at the topic-

                        How single threaded Node JS handles concurrency when multiple I/O operations are happening?

                        It means that, how does Node JS handle multiple client requests, even when it uses a single thread? Using a single thread would mean, that it would handle the request and response of a single client at a time. So, how does Node JS work when multiple clients are firing requests?</p>
